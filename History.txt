== 0.0.8 / 2012-04-12

* Bug fixes

  * Let perl handle its own input files (ARGF)... my implementation using IO.select was not working.

== 0.0.7 / 2012-04-11

* Bug fixes

  * Make sure UnixUtils.tmp_path doesn't create too-long filenames

== 0.0.6 / 2012-04-11

* Enhancements

  * iconv command silently discards invalid characters

== 0.0.5 / 2012-03-21

* Enhancements

  * Change pipe buffer size to 64kb (it was 4mb before), which seems to make everything run faster

* Bug fixes

  * Thanks to @leomao10, make sed work more reliably on large files by using its input-file argument rather than piping in data

== 0.0.4 / 2012-03-19

* Bug fixes

  * NoMethodError when trying to print $stderr - thanks @leomao10 !

== 0.0.3 / 2012-03-19

* Enhancements

  * Uses https://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn to make things faster - suggested by @jjb in https://github.com/seamusabshere/unix_utils/issues/1
  * Depends less on chdir to work properly - expands file paths immediately

* Bug fixes

  * Correctly use pipes (I hope) - imitate POSIX::Spawn::Child's use of IO.select

== 0.0.2 / 2012-02-16

* Bug fixes

  * Fix use of splat internally so that it actually runs in MRI 1.8.7 and JRuby
