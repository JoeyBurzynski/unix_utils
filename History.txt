== 0.0.3 / 2012-03-19

* Enhancements

  * Uses https://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn to make things faster - suggested by @jjb in https://github.com/seamusabshere/unix_utils/issues/1
  * Depends less on chdir to work properly - expands file paths immediately

* Bug fixes

  * Correctly use pipes (I hope) - imitate POSIX::Spawn::Child's use of IO.select

== 0.0.2 / 2012-02-16

* Bug fixes

  * Fix use of splat internally so that it actually runs in MRI 1.8.7 and JRuby

== 0.0.1 / 2012-02-16 (yanked!)

* Birthday!
